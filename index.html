		<!-- My app description -->
		<p>The Recipe Pad is basically an app that helps people add in their own recipes into their mobile device, so they will not forget the recipe that the have previously made that was so good. This app will also be organized through holidays. So if maybe you make certain food for certain holidays all the whole recipe will be at your fingertips.</p>
